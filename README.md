# CPP

Combinations of leetcode and some algorithm related problems

## C++ solutions

all the programs can be run using g++ compiler, I assume you have C++ 11 or higher as default
if not please specify that when compiling, this one is mine

```
    g++ std=c++17 program.cpp
    ./a.out
```

I have one header file (for now), in case need to be used, include that with an extra argument like this:

```
    g++ std=c++17 program.cpp -I headers/
```

This repo is more about solving problems and learning and not just leet-code, so may not always be perfect.
